To run the code, either open BandGapMapping.m and run the code, or open BandGapMapping.fig. This should open up a GUI. Load the Spectrum Image, or a single spectrum, fill inn suitable parameters and press "Run". To open the fitting results, either press "Open in resultsGUI" in BandGapMapping GUI, or save results, either by Autosave enabled or by "Save .mat" button. Open MappingResults.m and run code, or MappingResults.fig, then load the results .mat-file.

A User Manual for setting up the fit method and parameters are under development and will be uploaded soon.
